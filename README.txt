= GChart

== DESCRIPTION
  
GChart exposes the Google Chart API (http://code.google.com/apis/chart) via
a friendly Ruby interface. It can generate the URL for a given chart
(for webpage use), or download the generated PNG (for offline use).

== PROBLEMS/TODO

* Add support fills (area or background), grid lines, shape markers, range markers 
* Support shorthand colors and color names
* Make venn data specification friendlier

There are lots of missing features. Until they're implemented, you can directly specify
query parameters using the :extras key, e.g.,

  # provides a legend for each data set
  g = GChart.line(:data => [[1, 2], [3, 4]], :extras => { "chdl" => "First|Second"})

== SYNOPSIS

  # line chart
  g = GChart.line(:data => [0, 10, 100])
  
  # bar chart
  g = GChart.bar(:data => [100, 1000, 10000])
  
  # pie chart (pie3d for a fancier look)
  g = GChart.pie(:data => [33, 33, 34])
  
  # venn diagram (asize, bsize, csize, ab%, bc%, ca%, abc%)
  g = GChart.venn(:data => [100, 80, 60, 30, 30, 30, 10])
  
  # scatter plot (x coords, y coords [, sizes])
  g = GChart.scatter(:data => [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])
  
  # chart title
  g = GChart.line(:title => "Awesomeness over Time", :data => [0, 10, 100])

  # data set legend
  g = GChart.line(:data => [[1, 2], [3, 4]], :legend => ["Monkeys", "Ferrets"])

  # data set colors
  g = GChart.line(:data => [[0, 10, 100], [100, 10, 0]], :colors => ["ff0000", "0000ff"])
  
  g.to_url            # generate the chart's URL, or
  g.fetch             # get the bytes, or
  g.write("foo.png")  # write to a file (defaults to "chart.png")
  g.write(stream)     # write to anything that quacks like IO
